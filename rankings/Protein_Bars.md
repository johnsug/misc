## Protien Bars

### Bonk Breaker

| Flavor | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Almond Cherry Chunk | /5 | | 
| Cookies and Cream | /5 | |
| Salted Caramel | /5 | |
| Mint Chocolate Chip | /5 | | 
| Peanut Butter & Jelly | 3.5/5 | OK -- but not necessarily excited about eating another |

*Because you can't eat the bar all at once, I don't feel it'd make good race fuel, but would work well after an event*

### Endo Bars
