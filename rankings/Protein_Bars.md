### Rx Bars

| Flavor | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Chocolate Sea Salt | 5/5 | really good, taste might even compensate for difficulty in eating during a run |
| Apple Cinnamon | 4/5 | a tad too sweet, but good |
| Peanut Butter | 4/5 | grew on me as I ate it |
| Blueberry | 4/5 | perhaps a bit too sweet, slightly weird aftertaste |
| Mint Chocolate | 3.5/5 | ok |
| Coconut Cacao | 3/5 | edible, but not excited to eat another |
| Maple Sea Salt | 1/5 | nicht sehr gut / could not finish |
| Pumpkin Spice | /5 | |

*too difficult to eat during a run, unfortunately; better for post-workout fueling*

### Bonk Breaker

| Flavor | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Almond Cherry Chunk | /5 | | 
| Salted Caramel | /5 | |
| Mint Chocolate Chip | /5 | | 
| Peanut Butter & Jelly | 3/5 | ok -- but not necessarily excited about eating another |
| Cookies and Cream | 3/5 | ok |

*Because you can't eat the bar all at once, I don't feel it'd make good race fuel, but would work well after an event*

### Endo Bars

| Flavor | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Fig and Dark Chocolate | 2.5/5 | better than lemon cranberry, but still hard to get down |

*Meh*

### Picky Bars

| Flavor | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|--------|----------|

| Ah Fudge Nuts | 2.5/5 | a bitter brownie; hard to get down |
