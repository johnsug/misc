Miscellanous logs as I discover which forms of fitness nutrition work best for me. (Only re-purchase 4+)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Gold standard, go-to fuel option |
| 4 | Pretty good |
| 3 | Edible, but nothing to write home about |
| 2 | Hard to get down |
| 1 | Unable to get down |


*Note, stay away from Hammer Nutrition ... nasty, sour, floury, etc :/*
