### Tried (sorted by rank)

| Flavor | Net Carbs | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| PB Cup | 6g | 4.5/5 | was the gold standard, but Cookie Dough is making me question that... |
| Sea Salt Caramel | 7g | 4.5/5 | very good (but need to try again) |
| Cookie Dough| 8g | 4.5/5 | very good, but perhaps a *tad* too sweet? |
| Lemon Cake | 5g | 2.5/5 | ok, but a little flat; wouldn't try again |
| Vanilla Bean | 5g | 2/5 | sad dissapointment, did not finish *(was hoping it'd be more like the base of cookie dough...)* |
| Chocolate Banana | 7g | /5 | |
| Red Velvet | 8g | /5 | |
