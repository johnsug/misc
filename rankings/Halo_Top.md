## Halo Top Flavors

### Contenders (sorted by rank)

| Flavor | Net Carbs | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| PB Cup | 6g | 4.5/5 | was the gold standard, but Cookie Dough is making me question that... (but might still squeak ahead due to its lower carb count) |
| Cookie Dough | 8g | 4.5/5 | very good, but perhaps a *tad* too sweet? |
| Sea Salt Caramel | 7g | 4.5/5 | very good; base similar but not exactly the same as Cookie Dough's base |

### Cute Without the E (sorted by rank)

| Birthday Cake | 6g | 3.5/5 | tastes exactly like birthday cake; buy on special cakeday celebrations only? |
| Chocolate Banana | 7g | 3.5/5 | liked the banana flavor (Laffy Taffy!) but the chocolate sort of brought it down... maybe buy again if craving Laffy Taffy banana ? |
| Red Velvet | 8g | 3.5/5 | decent, though higher carb |
| Lemon Cake | 5g | 3/5 | didn't really like, but *maybe* try again?? |
| Mint Chip | 6g | 2.5/5 | mint sensation VERY strong, chocolate chips very bitter... |
| Oatmeal Cookie | 6g | 2.5/5 | kinda blah + oats were chewy/offsetting |
| Candy Bar | 8g | 2.5/5 | first time ok w/ a spoon of peanut butter; second time raw was unimpressed / nuts not very pleasant |
| S'mores | 8g | 2.5/5 | weird coconut/marshmallow cream flavor with weirder small, hard crunches; each bite was more and more disappointing :( |
| Chocolate | 5g | 2/5 | accidently bought, sad dissapointment; was expecting PB Cup's chocolate, was left with a sad fudgesicle |
| Rainbow Swirl | 6g | 1.5/5 | gross, could not finish (I guess I'm to blame... I was expecting it to taste like rainbow sherbet, but nope, not at all; just fruity disappointment) |
| Vanilla Bean | 5g | 1.5/5 | sad dissapointment, did not finish *(was hoping it'd be more like the base of cookie dough; nope, not at all)*

| Pancakes & Waffles | 8g | /5 | *maybe, but not sure carbs are worth it...* |
