## Halo Top Flavors

### Contenders (sorted by rank)

| Flavor | Net Carbs | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| PB Cup | 6g | 4.5/5 | was the gold standard, but Cookie Dough is making me question that... (but might still squeak ahead due to its lower carb count) |
| Cookie Dough| 8g | 4.5/5 | very good, but perhaps a *tad* too sweet/too many net carbs? |
| Sea Salt Caramel | 7g | 4*/5 | very good *(but need to try again) |
| Chocolate Banana | 7g | 3.5/5 | liked the banana flavor (laffy taffy!), but not sure I'd buy again |

### Cute Without the E (sorted by rank)

| Flavor | Net Carbs | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Lemon Cake | 5g | 2.5/5 | ok, but a little flat; wouldn't try again |
| Chocolate | 5g | 2.5/5 | accidently bought, sad dissapointment; was expecting PB Cup's chocolate, was left with a sad, melted fudgesicle |
| Vanilla Bean | 5g | 2/5 | sad dissapointment, did not finish *(was hoping it'd be more like the base of cookie dough; nope, not at all)* 

### Next to Try (sorted by net carbs)
