## Halo Top Flavors

### Contenders (sorted by rank)

| Flavor | Net Carbs | Rating | Thoughts |
|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| PB Cup | 6g | 4.5/5 | was the gold standard, but Cookie Dough is making me question that... (but might still squeak ahead due to its lower carb count) |
| Cookie Dough| 8g | 4.5/5 | very good, but perhaps a *tad* too sweet/too many net carbs? |
| Sea Salt Caramel | 7g | 4.5/5 | very good, although sweet; base similar but not exactly the same as Cookie Dough's base |

### Cute Without the E (sorted by rank)

|--------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Birthday Cake | 6g | /5 | |
| Chocolate Banana | 7g | 3.5/5 | liked the banana flavor (Laffy Taffy!) though chocolate was a little off-setting; would probably only buy again if really craving banana Laffy Taffy flavor |
| Rainbow Swirl | 6g | /5 | |
| Red Velvet | 8g | 3/5 | decent, though higher carb |
| Lemon Cake | 5g | 2.5/5 | ok, but a little flat; wouldn't try again |
| Oatmeal Cookie | 6g | 2.5/5 | kinda blah + oats were chewy/offsetting |
| Chocolate | 5g | 2/5 | accidently bought, sad dissapointment; was expecting PB Cup's chocolate, was left with a sad fudgesicle |
| Vanilla Bean | 5g | 1.5/5 | sad dissapointment, did not finish *(was hoping it'd be more like the base of cookie dough; nope, not at all)*
